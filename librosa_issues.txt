librosa was build against numpy 1.1.x, but only used by noisereduce
I checked the noisereduce github and realized that in the latest version there was a readme entry "removed librosa".
I assume for that very same reason of numpy.
So 
1. uninstall librosa
2. install noisereduce from source to get the latest version that does not depend on it.
3. install other stuff that was missing
4. run the code and be happy


pip uninstall librosa
pip install git+https://github.com/timsainb/noisereduce.git
pip install pyaml pydub psycopg2-binary influxdb
